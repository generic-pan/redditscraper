## How It Works
1. Scrape top images from a subreddit using the Reddit API (changing API rates might limit this)
2. Use PIL for image processing and caption image based on captured data
3. Use ffmpeg to merge images into .mp4 and add audio from given URL

## Project Purpose
Automate video creation, test Reddit web scraping, and explore PIL and ffmpeg
